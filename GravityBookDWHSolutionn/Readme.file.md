# Data Warehousing & BI Project

This project demonstrates the complete pipeline of a Business Intelligence (BI) solution, from data extraction to advanced analytics using Power BI. It includes steps to restore an OLTP database, build a data warehouse, implement ETL processes using SSIS, and perform data analysis through interactive dashboards.

## Project Stages

### 1. OLTP Database Restoration
- Restored the existing OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database using SSMS.
- Verified and configured the database schema and relationships.

### 2. Data Warehouse Design
- Designed a Data Warehouse using a star schema model.
- Created and normalized fact tables and dimension tables to support analytical workloads.
- Defined appropriate relationships and indexing to optimize performance.

### 3. ETL with SSIS
- Developed SSIS packages to automate the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process:
  - Extracted data from the OLTP database.
  - Transformed data to ensure quality, consistency, and conformity.
  - Loaded transformed data into th
